# netcode.io 1.0

**netcode.io** is a simple protocol for creating secure client/server connections over UDP.

This document describes the binary standard for the netcode.io, so that compatible implementations of this protocol can be created in multiple languages.

All data unless otherwise noted is written as binary in little endian order. The rationale is that the majority of machines that run the netcode.io protocol are little endian, so this is the least amount of work.
