# netcode.io 1.0

**netcode.io** is a simple protocol for creating secure client/server connections over UDP.

## Architecture

There are three main components in a netcode.io architecture:

1. The web backend
2. Dedicated servers
3. Clients

The web backend is a typical web server, for example nginx, which authenticates clients and provides a REST API. Clients are endpoints running the netcode.io protocol that want to connect to dedicated server instances. Dedicated servers are instances of the server-side portion of the game or application running on top of netcode.io, that run in data centers or the cloud.

The typical connection flow is as follows:

1. A client authenticates with the web backend
2. The authenticated client requests to play a game
3. A connect token is generated by the web backend and passed to that client over HTTPS
4. The client uses that connect token to establish a connection with a dedicated server over UDP
5. The dedicated server runs logic to ensure that only clients with a valid connect token may connect to it
6. Once connection is established, the client and server may exchange UDP packets. These packets are encrypted and signed.
