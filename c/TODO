DONE

    # of servers per connect token increased from 16 to 32.

    Private connect token is now zero padded to 1024 bytes for consistency

    Connect token buffer size reduced from 4096 to 2048.

    Server should return maximum # of clients to client inside connect token. It's important for client to know that it is client X/Y.

    Fixed bug where client didn't store its client index! Wow. whoops.
