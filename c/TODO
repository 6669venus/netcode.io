DONE

    # of servers per connect token increased from 16 to 32.

    Private connect token is now zero padded to 1024 bytes for consistency

    Connect token buffer size reduced from 4096 to 2048.

    Server should return maximum # of clients to client inside connect token. It's important for client to know that it is client X/Y.

    Fixed bug where client didn't store its client index! Wow. whoops.

    Reduced size of challenge token to 300 bytes. That's all that is needed.

    Removed the always 0 "reason" for connection denied. Pointless. There is only one reason :)

    Added some code on read connection payload packet to ignore packets with payload data size < 1. Otherwise, could have performed zero size allocation.

    Removed the connect token HMAC from the challenge token as it's no longer used.

    Added code to the encryption manager to expire the encryption manager at a future time. This lets the server to ignore clients who don't establish connection with the server within a short period of time.

    I noticed that I'm not caching the user data anymore. What's the point of providing user data in the binary, if it's not cached anywhere in the reference implementation?

    Added code to cache the user data per-client on connect, and an accessor function: netcode_server_client_user_data

TODO
    
    Should implement a client/server soak test, eg. repeated connect/disconnect, this is an important aspect to demonstrate stability of the server over time.

    Will also be good to check for memory leaks.
