DONE

    Need to direct netcode.io to github website

    Did this via my linode box + nginx. Should be able to test this in a few days once the DNS gets through.

    Verified this morning that the redirect works. Great!

    Added the coverity thingo for netcode.io, since it take a while for them to approve it.

    Get the project automatically built by travis, again copy from yojimbo.

    Need to write project README.md (adapt from white paper)

    Need to write project BUILDING.md (adapt from yojimbo)

TODO

    Write USAGE.md
