    Add code to make sure packets were exchanged.

    Add test for client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    Run valgrind.

    Run cppcheck.

    Port to linux

    To do this, setup a docker instance that can build the source code.

    Copy this from the "docker" server instance code in cppcheck.

    Done. Now iterating to get the linux C source code building cleanly.

    Vast majority of it is complaints about for loops, eg. for ( int i = 0; ... )

    Finished porting to linux

TODO
    
    Client outside of docker is not able to connect to a docker server. Why?
