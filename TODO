    Port across network simulator.

    Find a way to shim packets between client and server through the network simulator.

    -----------------

    Port across functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    It's important that the implementation is fully tested before I write the write paper, in case there are errors!

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.

    -----------------

    Integrate mbedtls and update client to get connect token from matcher.

    -----------------

    Write secure dedicated servers article (probably derived from white paper? Perhaps it's the same thing?)

    -----------------

    Write post announcing netcode.io and queue it up at GDC 2017.

    -----------------

    Finish porting rest of gafferongames.com to the new hugo website.
