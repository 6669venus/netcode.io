DONE

    Add code to make sure packets were exchanged.

    Add test for client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    Run valgrind.

    Run cppcheck.

    Port to linux

    To do this, setup a docker instance that can build the source code.

    Copy this from the "docker" server instance code in cppcheck.

    Done. Now iterating to get the linux C source code building cleanly.

    Vast majority of it is complaints about for loops, eg. for ( int i = 0; ... )

    Finished porting to linux

    Client outside of docker is not able to connect to a docker server. Why?

    Need to add logging to work out what is going wrong.

    It really looks like the docker server is just not receiving packets at all.

    Tested with the yojimbo server, and the yojimbo server *is* receiving packets inside docker.

    So what is going wrong here? What is different?

    Tried switching to IPv4 because yojimbo server was using ipv4. 

    Didn't make a difference. Server still doesn't receive packets from the client.

    What's going on? How can I debug this!?

    Port to windows

TODO

    Convert statics to per-client and per-server vars.

    Statics are bad. Make it impossible to wrap the library with mutex to guarantee thread safety.

    -----------------

    Write white paper

    -----------------

    *** BREAK ***

    -----------------

    Continue writing tests for security edge cases

    eg: stale connect token, modified AEAD, random connect token etc.

    -----------------

    Integrate mbedtls

    -----------------

    Write golang server to generate connect token.

    -----------------

    Update standalone client to get server info from golang server.

    -----------------

    Work out why docker server is not receiving packets from outside of docker.
