TODO

	Port across token functions and libsodium usage (as required by client). 

	This requires parsing JSON. What to use for this? RapidJSON is unfortunately C++. We're going C here.

	Alternatively, the library interface could be C, the implementation could be C++. 

	But I'd prefer C, for easy porting to other languages.

	Hmmmmm.
