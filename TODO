TODO

	Port across token functions and libsodium usage (as required by client). 

	This requires parsing JSON. What to use for this? RapidJSON is unfortunately C++. We're going C here.

	Alternatively, the library interface could be C, the implementation could be C++. 

	But I'd prefer C, for easy porting to other languages.

	Hmmmmm.

	Is there a small parser for JSON in C? Probably best to use that. Policy free. Include it. The parsing required is minimal. Absolutely minimal.

	Need a way to represent addresses to connect to. speednet_address_t?

	Goal: Up to 256 players per-server. Remove the 64 player max limit to support games like agar.io
