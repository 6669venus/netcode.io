    The test fails on the 256 client case at the end.

    It looks like clients get timed out, early, even while trying to connect, some early connected clients time out.

    Is there something wrong with packet delivery with so many clients?

    I think I've found it. There is a problem with encryption mapping last access time not getting updated.

    It needs to get updated each time I use the pre-cached encryption index.

    This means there needs to be a "touch" function in the encryption manager that takes an address and an encryption index.

    Yes!

    Fixed an error where the encryption mapping last time updated was not getitng updated. Does the same error exist in libyojimbo?

    It might, with the caching of the encryption index in the the error with 200 clients not all completing connection is still happening.

    Clearly this is a different error.

TODO

    So back to square one. Why is it that 200 clients aren't able to connect? Why are they timing out?

    It has to be something really stupid...

    -----------------

    client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    -----------------

    test server cases that should be rejected, eg. invalid connect token, stale connect token, same client id already connected.

    -----------------

    Run scan-build

    -----------------

    Run cppcheck.

    -----------------

    Run valgrind and make sure no memory leaks

    -----------------

    Port to linux

    -----------------

    Backport to windows

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.
