DONE

    Implement the remaining packet types.

    Implement the payload packet. Include a data length in the packet, but don't serialize that to the buffer. 

    On read, reconstruct it from what is left in the packet.

    Done. Made the payload packet type a variable size struct. Seems like the best option.

    Added a maximum payload size of 1400 bytes. Seems reasonable given 1500 MTU. In future versions of the protocol, might be nice to let the server tell the client the maximum # payload packet size instead. 

    For a first pass, I think this is OK.

    Added a function to create the dynamically sized payload packet.

    Need to add a test for payload packet. Done.

TODO

    -----------------

    Bring across a netcode_socket_t

    Implement just enough to get my shit done.

    Probably need more address functionality to interface with sockets sendto/recvfrom as well.

    -----------------

    Implement the client side of the state machine (simpler)

    -----------------

    Implement the server side of the state machine (up to 256 players, for agar.io)

    -----------------

    Unit test client/server functionality.

    -----------------

    Implement a stress test.

    -----------------

    Write white paper.
