DONE

    Here is a clue:

        server timed out client 86
        server disconnected client 86
        server timed out client 186
        server disconnected client 186
        client connection timed out
        client disconnected
        client connection timed out
        client disconnected

    Timeouts are occuring on both client and server.

    So it's not a logic error on client or server that is causing this.

    It looks like some packets for some clients are just not getting through.

    How could this be?

    The question then is:

    a) why are packets between client and server being lost?

    b) why does this only occur with high # of clients?

    It seems like the simulator might be hitting some limit for the # of packets that can be delivered each frame.

    Add code to print discarded packets at the start of each simulator update. It's possible that the simulator is discarding some packets.
    
    Yes, it was a logic error in the simulator receive packets when it hit the maximum. Fixed.

TODO

    -----------------

    client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    -----------------

    test server cases that should be rejected, eg. invalid connect token, stale connect token, same client id already connected.

    -----------------

    Run scan-build

    -----------------

    Run cppcheck.

    -----------------

    Run valgrind and make sure no memory leaks
