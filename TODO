DONE

    Unblocked to continue client error state tests.

    To test the next states, need to add a concept of "server flags"

    Server flags need to be added to:

        ignore connection request packets

        ignore connection response packets

        disable keep alive packets

    Adding this now.

    Added server flags. Testing the client error states should be easy now.

    These are the states to test:

    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT        -3
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT         -2
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_DENIED                  -1
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_DISCONNECTED                       0

    Getting started with connection_confirm_timeout.

    Added request time out as well.

    Found that connection confirm timeout state was redundant, so it's been removed.

    Thing to test now is connection denied. I can force a connection denied with a flag, but it would be much better to have a second client try to connect to a server with 1 slot, vs. testing an artificial codepath.

    connection denied test is working.

TODO

    client side disconnect

    server side disconnect

    client reconnect

    keep alive

    multiple clients

    stop/start

    -----------------

    test server cases that should be rejected, eg. invalid connect token, stale connect token, same client id already connected.

    -----------------

    At minimum, need tests for all the cases where a client connect can be rejected, eg. stale token, whitelist etc, random data etc.

    -----------------

    Port across functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    It's important that the implementation is fully tested before I write the write paper, in case there are errors!

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.

    -----------------



































    =======================================================================================

    Integrate mbedtls and update client to get connect token from matcher.

    -----------------

    Write secure dedicated servers article (probably derived from white paper? Perhaps it's the same thing?)

    -----------------

    Write post announcing netcode.io and queue it up at GDC 2017.

    -----------------

    Finish porting rest of gafferongames.com to the new hugo website.
