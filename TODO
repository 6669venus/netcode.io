    removed ifdefs around simulator and other stuff, no point doing this. it's a reference implementation.

    multiple clients. stop/start with different max clients in a loop

    Seems to be some bug with multiple clients test.

    Is the bug in the test, or in the code? 

    Bug was in the test. One down, but seems like these is another. Second iteration fails now...

    Something not getting cleared properly on server start/stop? Looks like it.

    On the second iteration, 0/32 clients can exchange packets, but on the first iteration if set to 32 max clients, all 32 work.

    So something is wrong on stop/start I think.

    Trying a test with second iteration being 1.

    Making first iteration 32, and it crashes after 32 clients connect. Something is wrong with the test (or the code...)

    Debug this first...

    Seems to be crashing on the second iteration, before any packets have been received.

    Is it crashing on connect, or after client connect?    

    Added logs.

    It is crashing on second iteration while the clients try to connect.

    I think this indicates a problem with something not being cleared properly on server in stop/start.

    Fixed some errors in the simulator, but still something is going wrong.

    I suspect an error in the server now. Something that breaks post-stop/start.

    It doesn't *crash* without simulator disabled, but also the clients don't connect on the second iteration.

    Working out why the clients don't connect is probably a good starting point.

    Pretty much confirmed. If I don't stop the server, the test passes.

    So something is wrong in server stop! What is it?!

    I'm pretty sure the bug was not clearing the global sequence or challenge sequence in stop. But I'm not sure how this would have that effect?

    Nope.

TODO

    The key problem seems to be that the server is not receiving packets from the client on the second iteration. Why is this?!

    Is it a problem at the socket layer?

    Is it a logic error in my code? I think any packets being ignored would be logged with a reason. So I'm not sure what would be going on here.

    -----------------

    client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    -----------------

    test server cases that should be rejected, eg. invalid connect token, stale connect token, same client id already connected.

    -----------------

    Run scan-build

    -----------------

    Run cppcheck.

    -----------------

    Run valgrind and make sure no memory leaks
