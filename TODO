TODO

    Need to implement a queue so the client can buffer payload packets for receive.

    Doesn't need to be sequence buffer, can be derived from simple queue in yojimbo.

    Port across the simple queue code.

    -----------------

    Add function to send and receive payload packets to/from server.

    -----------------

    Implement the server side of the state machine (up to 256 players, for agar.io)

    Gee this is going to be a lot of work...

    -----------------

    Get client connecting to server.

    -----------------

    Implement network simulator and shim for packets sent/received from client and server.

    -----------------

    Implement functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    -----------------

    Bring across matcher in golang and port to binary format connect tokens.

    Integrate mbedtls library.

    Port across code for matcher. Keep it blocking. Doesn't matter for now.

    Convert client to get server info from web server.

    -----------------

    Implement stress that connects 256 clients.

    -----------------

    Write white paper.
