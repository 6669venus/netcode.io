DONE

    Sketched out packets.

    Sketched out basic interface for reading and writing packets.

    This is going to work out pretty well.

    Extend code to take pointer to pointer for write bytes, so pointer can be advanced as writing is done.

    Implement helper functions to write uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, bytes.

    Implement helper functions to read uint8, uint16 etc.

    Implement packet read function for connection request packet.

    Write a test that verifies that we can write a connection request packet and then read it back in.

TODO

    Bring across code to encrypt/decrypt connect tokens.

    This is going to require a C library for generating and parsing JSON.

    What library should I use?

    -----------------

    Convert across code to generate a connect token, encrypt a connect token, decrypt a connect token.

    Add tests for generate, encrypt and decrypt connect tokens.

    -----------------

    Extend connection request packet read so that it decrypts the connect token.

    This allows for quick reject of connection packets before performaing allocation.

    Extend the connection request packet test so that it creates an actual connect token, encrypts it, verifies it is decrypted properly on read.

    -----------------

    Add tests for all the cases that should return NULL on connection request packet

    1. packet too small

    2. timestamp expired

    3. invalid connect token data

    4. timestamp modified from original (eg. AEAD signature early out)

    -----------------

    Implement read write for one of the other packet types.

    This involves designing the prefix byte, sequence # compression and encrypted data.

    The reader should perform decryption in place, so no allocation is made for a packet that doesn't pass the test. Quick reject is key.

    Once one encrypted packet type is tested working, implement the rest, adding tests for each packet type to make sure they are read/written correctly.
