DONE

    Continue processing connection response.

    Server is now sending connection denied back to client, but client is not receiving this. Why not?

    Fixed so connection denied response is processed while in sending connection response state.

    Add data structures to look up client by id, address.

    Port across functions to look up client by id, address.

TODO

    Extend the code to ignore connection request / connection response if the client address or id is already connected.

    -----------------

    Port across function to connect client

    -----------------

    Work out what the next state is for clients on connection response.

    Does the client get fully connected, with a pending flag, so the client keeps sending the keep-alive until connection is confirmed.

    Or do I extend the server-side to have a state per-slot, eg. 

        CLIENT_SLOT_FREE
        CLIENT_SLOT_PENDING
        CLIENT_SLOT_CONNECTED

    Think over this for a while, because any deviation from how yojimbo does it needs to have a good reason.

    -----------------

    Port across context manager above server.

    Add tests for context manager    

    -----------------

    Implement code to process connection response packet from client and complete connection.

    -----------------

    Work out what I need in the struct allocated per-client slot.

    -----------------

    Work out what arrays I need for fast O(n) lookups for incoming packets (keep them separate). Hot/cold split.

    -----------------

    Get client connecting to server.

    -----------------

    Implement network simulator and shim for packets sent/received from client and server.

    -----------------

    Implement replay protection.

    -----------------

    Implement functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    -----------------

    Bring across matcher in golang and port to binary format connect tokens.

    Integrate mbedtls library.

    Port across code for matcher. Keep it blocking. Doesn't matter for now.

    Convert client to get server info from web server.

    -----------------

    Implement stress that connects 256 clients.

    -----------------

    Write white paper.
