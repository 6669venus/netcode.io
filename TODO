    Setup a simple test for client/server connect derived from standalone client_server.c

    Test passes with client/server using sockets.

    Convert this test to use the network simulator. Make sure it still passes.

    Not only will this be the first client/server test, it will also check that the network simulator is working correctly.

    Wow. It passed second time. All I had to do was fix the client address to bind to a non-zero port. Wow!

    What other tests need to be brought across?

    At minimum, I need tests to reproduce all the error states on client connect.

    Start with this...

    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECT_TOKEN_EXPIRED              -7
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_INVALID_SERVER_INFO                -6
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT               -5
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT         -4
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT        -3
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT         -2
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_DENIED                  -1
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_DISCONNECTED                       0
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_SENDING_CONNECTION_REQUEST         1
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_SENDING_CONNECTION_RESPONSE        2
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_WAITING_FOR_CONNECTION_CONFIRM     3
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTED                          4

    Added test for client connect token expired state.

    Trying invalid server info test now... passes.

    Connection timed out test next. To do this, must establish connection, and then stop updating the server (without clean disconenct).

    Pretty easy...

    Not working. 

    Client connect to server was not actually working, it was timing out, but the test exited. Improve the test so it checks the client actually connected.

    Need to debug why the network simulator is not working.

    Seems that simulator is not receiving packets properly.

    Packets moved to pending receive seems to be working properly. Is pending receive working properly?

    Small logic error. Seems to be working now. all tests pass w. simulator.

TODO

    Unblocked to continue client error state tests.

    -----------------

    At minimum, need tests for all the cases where a client connect can be rejected, eg. stale token, whitelist etc, random data etc.

    -----------------

    Port across functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    It's important that the implementation is fully tested before I write the write paper, in case there are errors!

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.

    -----------------



































    =======================================================================================

    Integrate mbedtls and update client to get connect token from matcher.

    -----------------

    Write secure dedicated servers article (probably derived from white paper? Perhaps it's the same thing?)

    -----------------

    Write post announcing netcode.io and queue it up at GDC 2017.

    -----------------

    Finish porting rest of gafferongames.com to the new hugo website.
