DONE

    Update code to build test.c with custom netcode.c and with NETCODE_ENABLE_TESTS 1 defined.

    For other instances, disable tests, but leave it enabled by default in the code (standalone) so editors don't fuck up the test code.

    Done. Adjusted netcode.c to comment out parts related to simulator. All tests pass. Client/server standalone tests work fine, and don't include test code.

    Make sure client and server don't maintain pointer to network simulator when tests are off, just to be sure.

    Client done.

TODO

    -----------------

    Unblocked to continue client error state tests.

    -----------------

    At minimum, need tests for all the cases where a client connect can be rejected, eg. stale token, whitelist etc, random data etc.

    -----------------

    Port across functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    It's important that the implementation is fully tested before I write the write paper, in case there are errors!

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.

    -----------------



































    =======================================================================================

    Integrate mbedtls and update client to get connect token from matcher.

    -----------------

    Write secure dedicated servers article (probably derived from white paper? Perhaps it's the same thing?)

    -----------------

    Write post announcing netcode.io and queue it up at GDC 2017.

    -----------------

    Finish porting rest of gafferongames.com to the new hugo website.
