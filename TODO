DONE

    Standardized on "connect token" being the public facing name, with the internal encrypted connect token being the "private connect token".

    This is much better, seeing as the typical user would only see the "connect token", and that is a very intuitive name for the concept.

    Now the source code matches the white paper naming of concepts.

TODO

    -----------------

    Need to debug why docker server is not receiving packets from outside docker.

    -----------------

    Continue writing tests for security edge cases

    eg: stale connect token, modified AEAD, random connect token etc.
