TODO

    Actually, just passing in context for encryption keys is pointless.

    Just pass in the key directly. Context class may still exist, but it doesn't have to passed in this form to send and receive packet fns.

    -----------------

    Work out what I need in the struct allocated per-client slot.

    -----------------

    Work out what arrays I need for fast O(n) lookups for incoming packets (keep them separate). Hot/cold split.

    -----------------

    Get client connecting to server.

    -----------------

    Implement network simulator and shim for packets sent/received from client and server.

    -----------------

    Implement replay protection.

    -----------------

    Implement functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    -----------------

    Bring across matcher in golang and port to binary format connect tokens.

    Integrate mbedtls library.

    Port across code for matcher. Keep it blocking. Doesn't matter for now.

    Convert client to get server info from web server.

    -----------------

    Implement stress that connects 256 clients.

    -----------------

    Write white paper.
