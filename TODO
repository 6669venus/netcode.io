DONE

    Need to direct netcode.io to github website

    Did this via my linode box + nginx. Should be able to test this in a few days once the DNS gets through.

    Verified this morning that the redirect works. Great!

    Added the coverity thingo for netcode.io, since it take a while for them to approve it.

    Get the project automatically built by travis, again copy from yojimbo.

    Need to write project README.md (adapt from white paper)

TODO

    -----------------

    Need to write project BUILDING.md (adapt from yojimbo)

    Need to write USAGE.md show how to use the APIs

    Need to find a way to transition old gafferongames.com to new gafferongames.com

    Maybe a simple solution where it tries first to match on gafferongames, but if it can't find it on the new site, it falls back to the old website?

    This would allow automatic fallback, without a bunch of work on my part trying to manually find all links.

    -----------------

    Lower priority

    Get the project automatically build by coverity
