    Sketched out netcode_socket_t

    Actually, I need to bring across some stuff to netcode_init for winsock, eg. the WSAStartup for windows.

    Port across socket create function (99%)

    Port across remainder of socket create function with address conversions.

    Hook up the client to create a socket.

    Client create function should be extended take port # before current time.

    If the client fails to create a socket, print an error and return NULL when creating the client.

    Client should destroy socket when it is destroyed. Done.

TODO

    ------------------

    Port across send packet function.

    Port across receive packet function.

    ------------------

    Set up client context on connect, and clear it on disconnect.

    ------------------

    Set up array of client allowed packets.

    ------------------

    Port across code on the client to receive packets from the client and process those packets.

    Make sure the process packet code is separate from the client receive packet loop, so it can be pumped from elsewhere (eg. packets coming in from simulator)

    -----------------

    Port across the code to process client packets.

    -----------------

    Implement the server side of the state machine (up to 256 players, for agar.io)

    -----------------

    Get client connecting to server.

    -----------------

    Bring across matcher in golang and port to binary format connect tokens.

    -----------------

    Integrate mbedtls library.

    -----------------

    Port across code for matcher. Keep it blocking. Doesn't matter for now.

    -----------------

    Convert client to get server info from web server.

    -----------------

    Implement stress that connects 256 clients.

    -----------------

    Implement network simulator and shim for packets sent/received from client and server.

    -----------------

    Implement functional tests for client connect connection functionality.

    -----------------

    Write white paper.
