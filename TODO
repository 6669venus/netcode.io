DONE

    Unblocked to continue client error state tests.

    To test the next states, need to add a concept of "server flags"

    Server flags need to be added to:

        ignore connection request packets

        ignore connection response packets

        disable keep alive packets

    Adding this now.

    Added server flags. Testing the client error states should be easy now.

    These are the states to test:

    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT        -3
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT         -2
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTION_DENIED                  -1
    #define NETCODE_CLIENT_STATE_DISCONNECTED                       0

    Getting started with connection_confirm_timeout.

    Added request time out as well.

    Found that connection confirm timeout state was redundant, so it's been removed.

    Thing to test now is connection denied. I can force a connection denied with a flag, but it would be much better to have a second client try to connect to a server with 1 slot, vs. testing an artificial codepath.

    connection denied test is working.

    client side disconnect

    server side disconnect

    client reconnect

    ^--- found and fixed a bug where server was not decreasing "num connected clients" on the server when a client was disconnected.

    Add function netcode_server_num_connected_clients( server ), because otherwise the client has to O(n) to find this out, and that's dumb.

TODO

    keep alive

    multiple clients

    client connect to multiple servers, first few servers will fail, make sure client is able to connect to last one.

    stop/start

    -----------------

    test server cases that should be rejected, eg. invalid connect token, stale connect token, same client id already connected.

    -----------------

    Write white paper for patent.

    -----------------



































    =======================================================================================

    Integrate mbedtls and update client to get connect token from matcher.

    -----------------

    Write secure dedicated servers article (probably derived from white paper? Perhaps it's the same thing?)

    -----------------

    Write post announcing netcode.io and queue it up at GDC 2017.

    -----------------

    Finish porting rest of gafferongames.com to the new hugo website.
